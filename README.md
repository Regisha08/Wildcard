Pixel Art Generator

The project was created for individuals to use their creativity to create fun or useful images using pixels. I wanted to create something visual with an artistic attribute that will draw users attention. Begin your experience by selecting the size of the grid you desire and start using the pixels to display your artist abilites.

Installing
Step 1: Copy the Repository
Step 2: Git clone the repository onto your command line
Step 3: CD into your repository
Step 4: Open the Pixelart.html file into the browser(Firefox or internet explorer commonly used)
Step 5: You can either open the file from the editor or copy and paste the path of the file into the browser.
